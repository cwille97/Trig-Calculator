This website is basically a little quiz I made for memorizing the unit circle. It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascipt.
The code here is mostly my own with the exception of the timer, and the addElement and removeElement methods.





Things to work on:




Bugs:

1. The first time upon starting a new quiz, if you click Next Question before submitting an answer, no warning is administered. After this first answer is submitted and you click Next Question,
    it either works as intended or administers the correct warning.

2. Using enter to check answer only works the first time. Has not been implemented yet for next question

3. Timer continues when a question has been answered but the next question has not been displayed yet.
