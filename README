Things to work on:

Add score page functionality
Make next question more clear
Enter button works as check answer and next question
Change up styling


Bugs:

1. The first time upon starting a new quiz, if you click Next Question before submitting an answer, no warning is administered. After this first answer is submitted and you click Next Question,
    it either works as intended or administers the correct warning.

2. Using enter to check answer only works the first time. Has not been implemented yet for next question
